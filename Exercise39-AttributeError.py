# Question: The script is supposed to output the cosine of angle 1 radian, but instead, it is throwing an error. Please fix the code so that it prints out the expected output.

# import math
# print(math.cosine(1))
# Expected output:

# 0.5403023058681397

import math
print(dir(math))
print(math.cos(1))
